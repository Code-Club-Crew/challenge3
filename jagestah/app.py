    #all arguments need to ignore case
    #Argument 1 will be the data type such as Starship, Planet, etc
        #Call the entire data type and save the json
        #Will need to deal with pagination; can borrow from Challenge 1 alternative
    #Argument 2 will be a string that is searched for in the argument 1 data type
        #Add the entire entry to a results list to be printed at the end
    #Output will be a list of all results found
        #Print a count of the number of results found
        #Print a human readable list of the results and their Key-Value pairs

#Maybe add a third argument for the key user is looking for
    #IE `app.py starships destroyer name` to print the name of anything with a value of destroyer
